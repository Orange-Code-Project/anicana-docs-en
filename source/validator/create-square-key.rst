Generating Square Keys
###########################

Once your Validator application is accepted, you will need to generate Square Keys. You can generate up to five Square Keys per Validator.

Square Keys are key tokens required to generate EGG, which is essential for creating ARCANA NFTs. These keys can also be loaned to others.

Please note that this process will be carried out by the ANICANA Technical Support Team.
