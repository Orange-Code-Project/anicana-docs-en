Consensus Algorithm
###########################

ANICANA's consensus algorithm adopts IBFT (Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance). 
The Blocks generated by IBFT are signed by the block's proposing node and multiple validators, 
therefore have very high tamper resistance because it is necessary to know all of the private keys in order to tamper with them.
