Content Development Overview
####################################

By connecting your content to ANICANA, you can offer your content's users the opportunity to generate ARCANA NFTs. Depending on the results of their interactions with your content, users can acquire ARCANA NFTs with their preferred images and names in their wallets.

ARCANA NFTs are generated from EGGs held by the publisher. Each EGG carries genetic information that influences the "parameters" of the generated ARCANA NFTs. Additionally, when generating ARCANA from EGGs, content providers must provide a seed value to the ARCANA NFTs, which also affects the "parameters."
