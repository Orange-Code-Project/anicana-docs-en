PERSONA Overview
###########################

| PERSONA is an NFT that plays the role of a catalyst to trigger specific smart contracts on ANICANA. The smart contracts are ERC721 compliant.
| They are primarily created by publishers and offered to players (content users).
| The methods of offering may vary, including paid options and rewards in events.
| The generation of PERSONA requires both SQUARE and ANIMA.
| PERSONA has internal values, and Validators can set these internal values when generating PERSONA.

PERSONA Growth / Object Absorption Contract
=================================================================

| PERSONA can execute smart contracts to absorb (Absorbing) ARCANA objects (tokens) up to a specified number of times.
| Depending on the internal values of the objects being absorbed, the internal values of the absorbed PERSONA change, and the absorbed objects disappear. 
| This characteristic allows for the creation of various added values.
| 
| PERSONAs with high FORCE internal values primarily target ARCANAs with low FORCE values. 
| When a low-FORCE PERSONAs absorb a high-FORCE ARCANAs, there is a higher probability that the internal values of the absorbing PERSONAs will deteriorate.
| Players can enjoy the changes resulting from object absorption, and they can also utilize PERSONAs for collecting or selling high-ability PERSONAs on secondary marketplaces.

DrawChain / Contract to Retrieve Specific Data
======================================================================

| PERSONAs come with smart contracts called DrawChain, and when DrawChain is activated for SQUAREs, Validators can retrieve specified data (services) with the designated PERSONA. 
| The internal values of PERSONA can be set as conditional criteria to draw (retrieve) the data (services). 
| The usage history of DrawChain is recorded on the blockchain, and it can be limited, such as one-time use in the same event.
| 
| By developing PERSONA to increase its abilities (internal values), players can engage in secondary trading. Publishers can distribute limited items within their content events using DrawChain on SQUARE. This enables a variety of productions.
| Publishers can utilize DrawChain to distribute various items such as NFTs, tickets, cryptocurrencies, and points, creating attractive events.
